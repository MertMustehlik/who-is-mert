        "intro": "Hello, I'm Mert Müstehlik. I started my software career by developing CRM, ERP, and corporate web projects in my early years. During this process, I gained strong foundations in role-based authorization, data flows, integrations, and corporate business processes. I also gained experience in frontend development using Laravel Blade and Vue.js, contributing actively to both backend and frontend.",
        "projects": "Over time, I participated in larger and more complex projects, developing RESTful APIs, GraphQL services, high-traffic architectures, and user-focused admin panels. I work with Laravel, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and various modern web tools, designing modules end-to-end from analysis to development, optimization, and deployment.",
        "approach": "My working approach is based on clean code, correct architectural decisions, consistent data models, performance-focused solutions, and continuous learning. In every project, I aim to develop sustainable, scalable, and truly valuable software.",
        "motivation": "What motivates me most in software is seeing an idea turn into a real product with code. Witnessing an application making an impact in people's lives brings me joy and drives me to approach the next project with more excitement. Every piece of work I produce strengthens this passion."
